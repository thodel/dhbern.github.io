Publication formats are changing rapidly across research fields, including the Humanities. Under the umbrella term **Open Science**, the open, reusable, findable, and interoperable provision of publications and research data is promoted—but the transition towards open Humanities is not straightforward and involves long-term negotiation processes across stakeholders.

For the third time, **Digital Humanities** partnered with the **Open Science Team** of the University Library of Bern for the “...in Dialogue” series. The event combined keynote talks by leading scholars in Open Science with short inputs from projects based in Bern.

**Morning focus:** publication models (especially journals)  
**Afternoon focus:** publication forms for open data

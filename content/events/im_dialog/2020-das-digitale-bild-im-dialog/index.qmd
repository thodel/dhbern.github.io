Due to the epidemiological situation, this event was held online.

Images are an essential part of humanities research. They are analysed and published in disciplines such as art history, archaeology, history, theatre studies, and musicology. The “digital turn” has opened up countless new research avenues—from algorithmic analysis to making image collections available to research communities worldwide.

This workshop put **digital and digitised images** at the centre. Beyond showcasing new digital possibilities, it focused on a critical discussion of opportunities and risks in working with images. Libraries increasingly play a key role here: as service providers and as operators of infrastructure for image analysis. Together, we discussed which infrastructures and services researchers will need in the future and what new research questions these enable.

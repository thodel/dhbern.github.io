Machine learning relies on large datasets, yet data can embed imbalance and problematic representations of culture and society. This event brings together critical perspectives and applied data science to discuss how to address bias in data-hungry algorithms.
Date & place: 31 October 2022, Mittelstrasse 43, Room 320 (Bern)
The event is part of the series “Critical Perspectives on Digitization”.

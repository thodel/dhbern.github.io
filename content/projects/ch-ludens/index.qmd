CH LUDENS looks at a vibrant game design and development scene in the pre-Internet age. For decades, digital games were programmed in Switzerland in niches, but also with commercial success. They bear witness to many sub-scenes and a society changing through digitization.

The CONFOEDERATIO LUDENS team explores this largely ignored games industry from 1968 to 2000 and takes a step towards the broader preservation of a highly ephemeral and disappearing cultural heritage.

This project explored how **machine-learning language models** can generate short texts that *approximate the writing style* of specific authors.

For the Swiss National Library exhibition **“Aufgeschrieben. Stift, Taste, Spracherkennung”**, two separate language models were trained:

- one on historical texts by **Robert Walser**
- one on historical texts by **Emmy Hennings**

In the exhibition, visitors could select an author and complete a prompt such as *“Today I’m writing about …”* with a single word. The system then fed the prompt to the chosen model and generated a continuation—often extending the input into one or more sentences.

The experiment demonstrates, in an accessible way, how training data shapes a model’s vocabulary and syntax, and how “style imitation” depends on both the underlying corpus and the user’s prompt. It is intended for **research communication and teaching**, and encourages critical discussion about authorship, originality, and the limits of generative AI in the humanities.

Historical research increasingly makes use of digitization, benefiting from advancements in Handwritten Text Recognition and Natural Language Processing. This is where The Flow comes in and aims to promote the use of digital methods by developing a workflow that can be used by historians without expertise in information science and coding.

The Flow, running from 2023 to 2026, strives to create standardized digital workflows using existing technology, facilitating easier digital work with premodern historical sources.

The Flow is a joint project of the DH departments of the Universities of Bern and Bielefeld and the Research Centre for Hanse and Baltic History in Lübeck. The project is funded by the Swiss National Science Foundation (SNF) and the German Research Foundation (DFG).

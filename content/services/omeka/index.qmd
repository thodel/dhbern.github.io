The Digital Humanities unit at the University of Bern operates its own **Omeka S server**, which is available to all interested parties at the university.

**Omeka S** is an open-source content management system for publishing humanities content such as **digital exhibitions, texts, and images**. It supports the conscious use of **standards and ontologies**, making it well suited for projects that want to curate collections while keeping an eye on interoperability and reusable metadata.

## How to get access

You can request your own **subpage / site** at any time by emailing the Digital Humanities team.

## Support and training

**Introductions to Omeka S** are offered on demand (e.g., short onboarding sessions or project-specific guidance).

If you would like to use Omeka S for a course, a student project, or a research project, please get in touch and briefly describe your intended use.
